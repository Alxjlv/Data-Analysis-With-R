This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

```{r}
boxplot(SleepHrs ~ Deprived, data = sleepDep.df)
summaryStats(SleepHrs ~ Deprived, data = sleepDep.df)
```
* Centre: Mean sleep hours for deprived is lower than mean sleep hours for non deprived
* Spread: The spread is slightly wider for non deprived as compared to deprived
* Skew: Both Yes and No are fairly symmetrical without too significant of a tail.

An estimate of the mean sleep hours for a student who is not sleep deprived is 7.1 hours (rounded) while an estimate for the mean sleep hours for a student who self reports being sleep deprived is around 6.1 hours

We estimate that students who self reported no sleep deprivation slept for an average of 0.51 to 1.48 more hours than those who self reported being sleep deprived.

We estimate that the mean number of hours slept by students who did not self-report feeling sleep deprived is between 0.5 and 1.5 hours more than the mean number of hours slept by students who did. <- denise's explanation

The difference between the self reported sleep deprived mean and non self reported sleep deprived group mean is between 0.51 and 1.48 more hours of sleep
